Gosh How do I start?

I often beleive that when I come up with some idea about how to string togther some tools or automate a process that somone has done it already. Im fairly smart but there are plenty of smarts out there and many of them think about these sort of things way more that I do and have likely done already.

The other thig about this is that I love open source and think that there must be a decent implmentation out there too. This is a less frequent 'win' - sometimes the best solution is actually proprietray. However some of the best code in the world is open and I try hard to try and find it.

Once I have found that code the next thing is to run it. Building websites has been a perenial problem since the dawn of time - which is around 1992 for the web.
